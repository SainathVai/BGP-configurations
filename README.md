# BGP-configurations
For configuring BGP attributes / enabling backdoor for influencing path selection
# BGP Configurations Repository

This repository contains GNS3 network simulation projects focused on Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) configurations and best practices.

## Project Contents

- **BGP backdoor, peergroup and synchronization**: This simulation demonstrates how BGP backdoor routes work, how to configure peer groups for efficient BGP neighbor management, and the role of synchronization in BGP.

- **BGP best path attribute**: This project explores BGP path selection attributes and how they influence routing decisions in BGP.
